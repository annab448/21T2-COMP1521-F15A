The MIPS processor has 32 general purpose 32-bit registers, 
referenced as $0 .. $31. Some of these registers are intended to be used in 
particular ways by programmers and by the system. 
For each of the registers below, give their symbolic name and 
describe their intended use:


General Variables:
$8 = $t0 Temporary register ($t0 - $t9)
$16 = $s0 Saved register ($s0 - $s7)

Special Uses:
$0 = $zero The "zero" register
$2 = $v0 Return value
$4 = $a0 Argument register $a1 $a3
$29 = $sp Stack Pointer
$31 = $ra Return address

(probably) Don't Touchâ„¢:
$1 = $at "Assembler temporary"
$26 = $k0 Kernel register ($k1)
